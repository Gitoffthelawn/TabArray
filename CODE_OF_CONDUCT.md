**Main Text (English)**

The Human-life Information Platforms Institute and the Menhera.org community aim to offer a peaceful and friendly experience for every participant online and offline. All participants are expected to follow the spirits of this document. If you think that this document needs corrections, please feel free to start discussions.

## Respect & Inclusion

> We all thank everyone here for their attendance.

- **Do:** Recognize the value of every participant.

> Strive to make a safer space, but not exclusionarily.

- **Do:** Ensure that everyone feels welcome and safe, while fostering an environment of open dialogue and respect for different viewpoints.
- **Don't:** Please don't speak primarily for exclusion of someone as the mean of resolution, even if they made mistakes.

## Constructive Communication

> Please try not to attribute flaws or wrongs to a person or a group of people in general. We all share a world or a universe here where such (bad) things can exist.

- **Do:** Focus on issues and ideas rather than personal attacks, and approach disagreements with empathy and understanding.
- **Do:** Feel free to share your fears about the ongoing activities, even when you do not have alternative ideas/plans.
- **Don't:** Please don't accuse someone of denying communication when they have a different intrinsic way of communication. People have diverse ways of communication. Empathy does not always work, but try to understand them.

## Commitment to Positive Impact

> Imagine a world where every single person can better contribute to the online society in positive ways. Try to get closer to that.

- **Do:** Use your skills and resources to contribute positively to the whole community and the world. When you feel short of skills, you can learn ones here and there.
- **Do:** Uphold the principles of online privacy, diversity, and empowerment, in your ways, in all activities and initiatives.

## Know Limitations & Grow

> You're not expected to know everything. But have an idea to get by with, be willing to check back, and be willing to learn something new. Mistakes will happen. We will grow.

> We are all humans or at least, physics-bound creatures.Â  There are times you cannot do something well. That's fine, and we seek for feasible solutions which try best to respect everyone.

- **Do:** Try to communicate to others or to community leaders when you struggle with something.
- **Do:** Help others when they reach you to get help.
