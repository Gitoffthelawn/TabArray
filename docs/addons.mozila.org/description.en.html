This extension realizes Chrome-like tab groups using Firefox's secure and private container tabs.

Now private browsing is supported. No data is stored in persistent storage or sent elsewhere, whether or not in private browsing. You need to give permission to use the extension in private browsing.

<strong>No special configuration nor other add-ons required!</strong>

<strong>The button to show controls for containers is by default on the corner of the tab strip. The button has three dots in it.</strong>

<ol>
<li>Before starting a task, create a new container for it!</li>
<li>Open tabs related to the task in that container.</li>
<li>When finished, delete the container to remove all the clutters.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Isolated cookies/logins for each of tab groups because they are containers.</li>
<li>Per-window container management</li>
<li>Automatically sorts tabs based on containers</li>
<li>Show/hide tabs of a container</li>
<li>Create and delete containers as you like</li>
<li>Switch windows</li>
<li>Change the order of containers</li>
<li>Enables First-Party Isolate (FPI) by default (configurable)</li>
<li>Panorama Grid - View all the tabs in a nice grid sorted by Containers.</li>
<li>Choose a container for each new Tab opened by external applications.</li>
<li>List tabs by websites in a window.</li>
<li>Button to clear cookies for a container.</li>
<li>List and delete cookies by sites in a container.</li>
<li>Option to remove cookies automatically for a container when closing it.</li>
</ul>

Keyboard shorcuts (can be changed or disabled in Add-ons Manager):
<ul>
<li>Ctrl+Alt+G: Open the containers popup.</li>
<li>Ctrl+Alt+S: Open the containers sidebar.</li>
</ul>

This add-on is probably compatible with the Firefox Multi-Account Containers add-on. But you do not need it for this addon to operate.

<strong>This may not be compatible with our previous add-on "Site-based Tabs." Please disable the old one if you find any problems.</strong>

This extension is currently not compatible with Tree Style Tab extension, but we are working on improve compatiblity with it. See more compatibility information (additions welcome) at https://github.com/menhera-org/TabArray#compatiblity .

<strong>Perfect replacement for Chrome's tab groups and the discontinued add-on Conex.</strong>

<strong>This extension is actively developed/maintained as of 2022, so please wait for new features/fixes.</strong>
