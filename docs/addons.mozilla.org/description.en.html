<strong>Compatibility and other extensions</strong>

Now private browsing is supported. No data is stored in persistent storage or sent elsewhere, whether or not in private browsing. You need to give permission to use the extension in private browsing.

This add-on is probably compatible with the Firefox Multi-Account Containers add-on. But you do not need it for this addon to operate.

<em>This may not be compatible with our previous add-on “Site-based Tabs.” Please disable the old one if you find any problems.</em>

This extension is compatible most tab management extension such as Tree Style Tab extension. See more compatibility information (additions welcome) at <a href="https://github.com/menhera-org/TabArray#compatiblity">https://github.com/menhera-org/TabArray#compatiblity</a> .

<em>Perfect replacement for Chrome’s tab groups and the discontinued add-on Conex.</em>

<strong>Development</strong>

This extension is actively developed/maintained as of 2023, so please wait for new features/fixes.
