<strong>Version 11.0.0</strong>

This is a major rewrite of the extension. (However, most features are the same.)
Now using TypeScript, we aim to reduce bugs.

New features:

<ul>
<li>Supporting Private Browsing. Only the default container is available in private windows.</li>
<li>Open an externally-opened tabs in a private window.</li>
<li>Button to clear cookies for a container.</li>
<li>Sort containers in Preferences. (This affects the order of tabs and the menus. No effects on other extensions.)</li>
</ul>
