# Version 11.0.0

This is a major rewrite of the extension. (However, most features are the same.)
Now using TypeScript, we aim to reduce bugs.

New features:

- Supporting Private Browsing. Only the default container is available in private windows.
- Open an externally-opened tabs in a private window.
- Button to clear cookies for a container.
- Sort containers in Preferences. (This affects the order of tabs and the menus. No effects on other extensions.)
